A modular framework for orchestrating and managing complex Large Language Model (LLM) workflows, including prompt engineering, model chaining, and evaluation.

## Features

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Tools for designing, testing, and optimizing prompts.
*   **Model Chaining:** Connect multiple LLMs or other AI models in a sequence.
*   **Evaluation:** Metrics and methodologies for assessing LLM performance.
*   **Scalability:** Designed for deployment in distributed environments.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   FastAPI
*   LangChain
*   Hugging Face Transformers
*   Docker

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prelf1992/llm-orchestration-framework.git
cd llm-orchestration-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```python
from framework.orchestrator import LLMOrchestrator
from framework.prompts import PromptTemplate

orchestrator = LLMOrchestrator()

# Example: Simple prompt
prompt = PromptTemplate("Translate the following English text to French: {text}")
result = orchestrator.run(prompt, text="Hello, world!")
print(result)
```
